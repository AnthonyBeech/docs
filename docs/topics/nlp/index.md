# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing combines computational linguistics with machine learning to help computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Fundamentals

### Core Concepts
- **Tokenization** - Breaking text into words/sentences
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** - Reducing words to root forms
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging** - Identifying grammatical roles
- **Named Entity Recognition** - Identifying people, places, organizations

### Text Preprocessing
- Cleaning and normalization
- Stop word removal
- Handling special characters
- Unicode and encoding issues

## Text Representation

### Traditional Methods
- **Bag of Words (BoW)** - Word frequency counting
- **TF-IDF** - Term frequency-inverse document frequency
- **N-grams** - Sequences of words
- **Word co-occurrence matrices**

### Modern Embeddings
- **Word2Vec** - Skip-gram and CBOW
- **GloVe** - Global vectors for word representation
- **FastText** - Subword embeddings
- **Transformer-based** - BERT, GPT, RoBERTa

## Tasks and Applications
