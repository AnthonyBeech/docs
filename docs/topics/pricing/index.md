# Pricing Analytics

Pricing analytics involves using data science techniques to optimize pricing strategies, understand price sensitivity, and maximize revenue.

## Fundamentals

### Key Concepts
- **Price Elasticity** - Responsiveness of demand to price changes
- **Revenue Optimization** - Maximizing total revenue
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** - Total value of customer relationship
- **Market Segmentation** - Grouping customers by characteristics

### Pricing Strategies
- Cost-plus pricing
- Competitive pricing
- Value-based pricing
- Dynamic pricing
- Psychological pricing

## Data Sources

### Internal Data
- Historical sales and pricing
- Customer transaction records
- Product costs and margins
- Inventory levels
- Customer demographics

### External Data
- Competitor pricing
- Market conditions
- Economic indicators
- Seasonal patterns
- Consumer sentiment

## Analytical Methods

### Price Elasticity Analysis
- **Linear regression** - Basic price-demand relationship
- **Log-log models** - Constant elasticity estimation
- **Survival analysis** - Time to purchase modeling
- **Discrete choice models** - Customer decision modeling

### Segmentation Analysis
- **K-means clustering** - Customer grouping
- **RFM analysis** - Recency, frequency, monetary value
- **Cohort analysis** - Customer behavior over time
- **Decision trees** - Rule-based segmentation

### Advanced Techniques
- **Machine learning** - Random Forest, XGBoost for price prediction
- **Deep learning** - Neural networks for complex patterns
- **Bayesian methods** - Uncertainty quantification
- **Causal inference** - Understanding price impact

## Applications
